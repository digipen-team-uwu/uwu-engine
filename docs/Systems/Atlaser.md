# Atlaser

The atlaser is a system of [uwu Engine](../../README.md).

Atlaser system packs all textures from texture loader into one big atlas page and give location of that texture to corresponding entity. To be able to have multiple atlas pages, we use 2D array texture with each layer is one atlas page with the size of 4k by 4k.
